However, currently offline MARL lacks a standardised benchmark for measuring meaningful research progress.

This means that its significantly easier to install and use OG-MARL.</p> <p>\u2705 We added functionality to pre-load the TF Record datasets into a Cpprb replay buffer. This speeds up the time to sample the replay buffer by several orders of magnitude.</p> <p>\u2705 We have implemented our first set of JAX-based systems in OG-MARL. Our JAX systems use Flashbax as the replay buffer backend. Flashbax buffers are completely jit-able, which means that our JAX systems have fully integrated and jitted training and data sampling.</p> <p>\u2705 We have integrated MARL-eval into OG-MARL to standardise and simplify the reporting of experimental results.</p>"},{"location":"updates/#need-for-speed","title":"Need for Speed \ud83c\udfce\ufe0f","text":"<p>We have made our TF2 systems compatible with jit compilation.

This allows Oryx to solve complex coordination challenges while maintaining temporal coherence over lengthy trajectories. We evaluate Oryx across a diverse set of benchmarks from prior works\u2014SMAC, RWARE, and Multi-Agent MuJoCo\u2014covering tasks of both discrete and continuous control, varying in scale and difficulty. Oryx achieves state-of-the-art performance on more than 80% of the 65 tested datasets, outperforming prior offline MARL methods and demonstrating robust generalisation across domains with many agents and long horizons.

Catastrophe, if you\u2019re not careful! This is the topic of our work on \u2728Coordination Failure in Offline Multi-Agent Reinforcement Learning \u2728</p> <p></p> <p>Many offline MARL methods build on an MADDPG-style update, which we call the \u201cBest Response Under Dataset\u201d (BRUD). Essentially, agents optimise their action in best response to the other agents\u2019 actions, as sampled from the dataset \ud83e\udd3c</p> <p> But this can lead to catastrophic miscoordination! \ud83e\udd4a </p> <p>To illustrate this phenomenon, we use polynomial games for tractable insights. For example, consider a simple game, \\(R = xy\\), dubbed the \"sign-agreement\" game. Agents X and Y aim to choose actions of the same sign (\\(++\\) or \\(--\\)) to yield good rewards. \ud83d\udcc8</p> <p></p> <p>Suppose in this game that Agent X currently takes a NEGATIVE action, and Agent Y currently takes a POSITIVE action\u2014illustrated by the Current Policy on the left. Now suppose we sample a point from the static dataset, where X took a POSITIVE action and Y took a negative action, illustrated on the right.</p> <p></p> <p>With a BRUD-style update, the agent policies will update according to the illustration below. Agent X looks at the datapoint, where Y took a negative action, and makes its action more negative in best response. The opposite happens for Agent Y when looking at the datapoint from X, making its action more positive.</p> <p></p> <p>The result is catastrophic! Agents move towards a low-reward region, in the opposite direction of the true optimal update. Our work goes further to ground this result mathematically, and demonstrates how and why other instances of miscoordination arise in a variety of polynomial games. \ud83e\udd13</p> <p></p> <p>How do we solve this problem? Our key insight is that miscoordination arises because of  the dissimilarity between the current joint policy output, and the sampled joint action.</p> <p> \u26a0\ufe0f Not all data is equally important at all times \u26a0\ufe0f </p> <p>Instead: we want to prioritise sampling experience from a dataset-generating policy similar to the current joint policy. We do this by setting the priorities to be inversely proportional to some function of the distance between the policies.</p> <p>We call this Proximal Joint-Action Prioritisation (PJAP) \ud83e\udd20</p> <p>Returning to the sign-agreement game from before, here we see how vanilla MADDPG using a static dataset fails to learn the optimal policy \ud83d\ude2d But the experience is just sampled uniformly from the dataset!</p> <p></p> <p>If we instead prioritise sampling actions that are close to our current joint policy, using PJAP, then MADDPG can find the optimal reward region! \ud83c\udf89</p> <p></p> <p>Here\u2019s a visualisation of the priorities in the underlying buffer. Prioritised experience replay is already a popular tool in RL, so PJAP can easily be integrated with existing code. \ud83d\ude0c</p> <p></p> <p>In a more complex polynomial game, clear improvement occurs once again. Crucially, we see how the mean distance between the sampled actions and current policy is reduced, which leads to higher returns. \ud83d\udc83</p> <p></p> <p>Excitingly, this result transfers to more complex scenarios! Here we look at 2halfcheetah from MAMuJoCo, and see that PJAP yields lower average distance between the sample actions and the current joint policy, which leads to statistically significant higher returns \ud83d\udc06\ud83d\udd25</p> <p></p> <p>Importantly, our work shows how insights drawn from simplified, tractable games can lead to useful, theoretically grounded insights that transfer to more complex contexts.

It is thus important that we compare, for a given integer x, the results across various combinations of x reincarnated agents. That is, e.g., compare reincarnating the back ankle and back knee (BA, BK) with the back ankle and back hip (BA, BH). We find that the choice of which agents to reincarnate plays a significant role in the experiment\u2019s outcome.</p>"},{"location":"research/selective-reincarnation/#best-and-worst-of-three-reincarnated-agents","title":"Best and Worst of Three Reincarnated Agents","text":""},{"location":"research/selective-reincarnation/#best-and-worst-of-four-reincarnated-agents","title":"Best and Worst of Four Reincarnated Agents","text":""},{"location":"research/selective-reincarnation/#best-and-worst-of-five-reincarnated-agents","title":"Best and Worst of Five Reincarnated Agents","text":""},{"location":"research/selective-reincarnation/#cite","title":"Cite","text":"<pre><code>@inproceedings{\n    formanek2023selective,\n    title={Reduce, Reuse, Recycle: Selective Reincarnation in Multi-Agent Reinforcement Learning},\n    author={Juan Claude Formanek and Callum Rhys Tilbury and Jonathan Phillip Shock and Kale-ab Tessera and Arnu Pretorius},\n    booktitle={Workshop on Reincarnating Reinforcement Learning at ICLR 2023},\n    year={2023},\n    url={https://openreview.net/forum?id=_Nz9lt2qQfV}\n}\n</code></pre>"}]}
