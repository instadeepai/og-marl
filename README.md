## Going Off-the-Grid! 🤖 ⚡ 🔌 🔋

Offline MARL holds great promise for real-world applications by utilising static datasets to build decentralised controllers of complex multi-agent systems. However, currently offline MARL lacks a standardised benchmark for measuring meaningful research progress. Off-the-Grid MARL (OG-MARL) fills this gap by providing a diverse suite of datasets with baselines on popular MARL benchmark environments in one place, with a unified API and an easy-to-use set of tools.

OG-MARL forms part of the [InstaDeep](https://www.instadeep.com/) MARL [ecosystem](#see-also-🔎), developed jointly with the open-source
community. To join us in these efforts, reach out, raise issues or just
🌟 to stay up to date with the latest developments! 📢 You can contribute to the conversation around OG-MARL in the [Discussion tab](https://github.com/instadeepai/og-marl/discussions). Please don't hesitate to leave a comment. We will be happy to reply.

> 📹 NeurIPS video: [https://neurips.cc/virtual/2024/poster/97812](https://neurips.cc/virtual/2024/poster/97812)

> 📢 We recently moved our datasets to Hugging Face. This means that previous download links for the datasets may no longer work. Datasets can now be downloaded directly from [Hugging Face](https://huggingface.co/datasets/InstaDeepAI/og-marl).

## Quickstart 🏎️
Clone this repository.

`git clone https://github.com/instadeepai/og-marl.git`

Install `og-marl` and its requirements. We tested `og-marl` with Python 3.10 and Ubuntu 20.04. Consider using a `conda` virtual environment.

`pip install -e .[tf2_baselines]`

Download environment files. We will use SMACv1 in this example. MAMuJoCo installation instructions are included near the bottom of the README.

`bash install_environments/smacv1.sh`

Download environment requirements.

`pip install -r install_environments/requirements/smacv1.txt`

Train an offline system. In this example we will run Independent Q-Learning with Conservative Q-Learning (iql+cql). The script will automatically download the neccessary dataset if it is not found locally.

`python og_marl/tf2_systems/offline/iql_cql.py task.source=og_marl task.env=smac_v1 task.scenario=3m task.dataset=Good`

You can find all offline systems at `og_marl/tf2_systems/offline/` and they can be run similarly. Be careful, some systems only work on discrete action space environments and vice versa for continuous action space environments. The config files for systems are found at `og_marl/tf2_systems/offline/configs/`. We use [hydra](https://hydra.cc/docs/intro/) for our config management. Config defaults can be overwritten as command line arguments like above.

## Dataset API 🔌

To quickly start working with a dataset you do not even need to install `og-marl`. 
Simply install Flashbax and download a dataset from [Hugging Face](https://huggingface.co/datasets/InstaDeepAI/og-marl). 

`pip install flashbax`

Then you should be able to do something like this.

```
from flashbax.vault import Vault
import jax
import numpy as np

vault = Vault("og_marl/smac_v1/2s3z.vlt", vault_uid="Good")

experience = vault.read().experience

numpy_experience = jax.tree.map(lambda x: np.array(x), experience)
```

We also provide a simple demonstrative notebook of how to use OG-MARL's dataset API here:

[![Colab](https://colab.research.google.com/assets/colab-badge.svg)](https://colab.research.google.com/github/instadeepai/og-marl/blob/main/examples/dataset_api_demo.ipynb)

## Datasets 🎥

We have generated datasets on a diverse set of popular MARL environments. A list of currently supported environments is included in the table below. It is well known from the single-agent offline RL literature that the quality of experience in offline datasets can play a large role in the final performance of offline RL algorithms. Therefore in OG-MARL, for each environment and scenario, we include a range of dataset distributions including `Good`, `Medium`, `Poor` and `Replay` datasets in order to benchmark offline MARL algorithms on a range of different dataset qualities. For more information on why we chose to include each environment and its task properties, please read our accompanying [paper](https://arxiv.org/abs/2302.00521).

<img src="docs/assets/hugging_face.png" alt="Hugging Face logo" width="25%"/>

Our datasets are now hosted on Hugging Face for improved accessibility for the community: [https://huggingface.co/datasets/InstaDeepAI/og-marl](https://huggingface.co/datasets/InstaDeepAI/og-marl)

> ⚠️ Some datasets have yet to be converted to the new dataset format (Vault). For available datasets, please refer to `og_marl/vault_utils/download_vault.py` or the Hugging Face datasets repository.

## Installing MAMuJoCo 🐆

The OG-MARL datasets use the latest version of MuJoCo (210). While the OMIGA and OMAR datasets use an older version (200). They each have different instalation instructions and should be installed in seperate virtual environments.

#### MAMuJoCo 210

`bash install_environments/mujoco210.sh`

`pip install -r install_environments/requirements/mujoco.txt`

`pip install -r install_environments/requirements/mamujoco210.txt`

#### MAMuJoCo 200

`bash install_environments/mujoco200.sh`

`pip install -r install_environments/requirements/mujoco.txt`

`export LD_LIBRARY_PATH=$LD_LIBRARY_PATH:~/.mujoco/mujoco200/bin`

`pip install -r install_environments/requirements/mamujoco200.txt`
